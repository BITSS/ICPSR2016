Registration and Pre-Analysis Plans
===================================

by Garret Christensen

This file describes a few activities to work through to get hands-on experience with pre-analysis plans and registration.

1. Draft a Pre-Analysis Plan
Begin to write a pre-analysis plan for a statistical analysis project that you are currently working on. This could be something that you plan to work on in the future, or maybe have already started but haven't completely finished. Or perhaps it would still be useful to think about what would have happened if you had tried to write a PAP for a project that you have completed--i.e., what parts would it have been possible for you to pre-specify, and what parts would have been impossible?
2. If you don't have a project you feel you could work on, a few examples are:

  a. The WASH Benefits Project. An on-going water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition RCT in Kenya and Bangladesh. The project wrote a protocol that includes a relatively detailed statistical analysis plan. What information, if any, do you think is missing?

  b. The *Gobifo* community driven development project in Sierra Leone. Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel wrote a PAP here. The final paper is here. What information, if any, is missing? Is there analysis conducted that wasn't in the PAP?

  c. The Oregon Medicaid Expansion Lottery. Oregon had a lottery to expand Medicaid, leading to a good experimental design to study important health outcomes. The PAP and papers are available here.

3. With your own work, or the example PAP:
  a. Go through the PAP using Alejandro Ganimian's template. Complete the template, or see if you can find material
